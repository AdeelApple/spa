# Description:
Shortest path algorithm (SPA) is a javascript project used to explore these algorithms:

<ol>
  <li>Dijkstra's algorithm</li>
  <li>Depth first search</li>
<ol>

Dijkstra's algorithm: is used to find the shortest path between two selected nodes
Depth first search algorithm: used to find the path between two nodes where minimum nodes coming in the way.
